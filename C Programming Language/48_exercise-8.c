// Dynamic memory allocation
// ABC Pvt. Ltd. manages  employee records of other companies.
// Employee Id can be of any length and it can contain any character
// For 3 employees, you have to take 'length of employee id' as input in a legth integer variable
// Then, you have to take employee id as an input and display in on screen
// Store the employee id in a character array which is allocated dynamically
// You have to create only one character array dynamically
// Example:
// Employee 1:
// Enter no of characters in your eId
// 45;
// Dynamically allocate the character array
// take input from user

// Employee 2:
// Enter no of characters in your eId
// 4;
// Dynamically allocate the character array
// take input from user

// Employee 3:
// Enter no of characters in your eId
// 9;
// Dynamically allocate the character array
// take input from uswer
