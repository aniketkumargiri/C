// Data structure: Way to arrange data in main memory for efficient uses
// eg: arrays, linked list, stakcs, queues, trees, graphs, etc.

// Algorithms : sequence of steps to solve a given problem using data structures
// eg: sorting an array, searching for an element

// Database: collection of information in permanent storage for faster execution
// Data in RAM gets deleted after the execution of the program.So, if we want data to be stored, we have to keep it in the Hard Drive / Disk
// Data warehousing: Management of huge amount of legacy data for better analysis
// Big Data: Analysis of too large or complex data which cannot be dealt with traditional data processing applications
